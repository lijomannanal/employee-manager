<br>

## Commands
All the commands listed should be ran in project directory (employee-manager).

### Installing dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
<br>

### Starting Project
Starting the project in local environment.
This will start all the dependencies services i.e. database and external (folder).
```bash
npm start
```

### Accessing the GUI
http://localhost:3000

### Things to note

1) Used redux saga library to handle side effects

2) Added warning message if the user leaves the edit form after making some changes

3) For intial loading, the app would fetch the data from 'https://6164f6e709a29d0017c88ed9.mockapi.io/fetest/employees', then it saves the data to localstorage.

If you want to use the intial dataset, just clear the localstorage from the browser
